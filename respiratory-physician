<p><strong>Referral</strong></p>
<p>Please email your referral to <a href="mailto:reception@woolcock.org.au">reception@woolcock.org.au</a> prior to your appointment. Please note that a specialist referral is valid for 3 months and a GP referral is valid for 12 months. Without a valid referral at the time of your consultation/treatment, Medicare will not be able to process your claim.</p>
<p>Approval documentation from your Insurer needs to be provided in the case of a Workers&rsquo; Compensation or Third-Party Claim. If not supplied, payment will need to be made on the day by the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Ahead of your appointment</strong></p>
<p>Please send the following information to <a href="mailto:reception@woolcock.org.au">reception@woolcock.org.au</a> (or reply to this email) before you appointment date.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Skype address</li>
<li>Any test results (for example, blood tests, X-rays, scans)</li>
<li>A medication list</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Payment/cancellation:</strong></p>
<p>The cost of your initial consultation will be between $310 and $450 depending on the complexity of the consultation. We accept EFTPOS, credit cards including AMEX without surcharge (no Diners Club), or cash. We can submit your claim to Medicare on site with a valid referral and Medicare details.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a private clinic and we do not Bulk Bill as a standard rule.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation Fees</strong></p>
<p>When a patient cancels their appointment or does not attend without giving notice, they prevent another patient from being seen.&nbsp; Therefore, your Doctor requires a 48-hour cancellation notice for any appointment changes. A charge of $100 will apply for any appointment changes that may occur without appropriate notice.&nbsp;</p>
