<p>Dear [FIRST_NAME],</p>
<p>This email confirms your lung function test appointment on [APPOINTMENT_DATE] at [APPOINTMENT_TIME] at the Woolcock Clinic.</p>
<p><strong>Referral</strong></p>
<p>If you have a referral from another clinic, please email your referral to <a href="mailto:reception@woolcock.org.au">reception@woolcock.org.au</a> prior to your appointment. Without a valid referral at the time of your test, Medicare will not be able to process your claim.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Insurance</strong></p>
<p>Approval documentation from your Insurer needs to be provided in the case of a Workers&rsquo; Compensation or Third-Party Claim. If not supplied, payment will need to be made on the day by the patient.</p>
<p><strong>What to bring</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Your Medicare/DVA card/Pension card</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Payment for your test:</strong></p>
<p>For spirometry only the fee is $105. For a full lung function test the fee is $240. We can submit your claim to Medicare on site, as long as you have a valid referral and Medicare details.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a private clinic. We do not Bulk Bill.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation Fees</strong></p>
<p>When a patient cancels their appointment or does not attend without giving notice, they prevent another patient from being seen.&nbsp; Therefore, we require 2 business days notice for any appointment changes. A charge of $100 will apply for any appointment changes that may occur without appropriate notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do not reply to this email as this address is not monitored. Instead, email <a href="mailto:reception@woolcock.org.au">reception@woolcock.org.au</a>. We look forward to welcoming you at the Woolcock Clinic and wish you all the best for your visit.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p><strong>The Reception Team</strong></p>
