<p>Please note that this is a private clinic and Dr Kannangara doesn&rsquo;t Bulk Bill.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation Fees</strong></p>
<p>When a patient cancels their appointment or does not attend without giving notice, they prevent another patient from being seen.&nbsp; Therefore, we require 2 business days notice for any appointment changes. A charge of $100 will apply for any appointment changes that may occur without appropriate notice.&nbsp;</p>
