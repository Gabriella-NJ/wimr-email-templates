<p><strong>Screening for COVID 19</strong></p>
<p>For the safety of staff and patients, we are now asking all visitors to the Woolcock Clinic&nbsp;including patients, parents, or carers&nbsp;to perform a COVID test ahead of their sleep study. This could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A PCR test done within 48 hours</li>
<li>A rapid antigen test performed at the Woolcock Clinic. Kits can be provided at the cost of $12.00 or you can bring your own. The test must be performed under the supervision of our technicians</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <strong>do not attend </strong>your appointment if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been diagnosed with COVID-19</li>
<li>You have had any of the following <a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/frequently-asked-questions.aspx#1-4">symptomsâ€‹</a>&nbsp;in the last 14 days:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><strong>Payment of your sleep study and cancelling or changing your appointment</strong></p>
<p>As a self-funded patient, you are required to pay the full costs for your overnight study/ home based sleep study. We will ask you to pay this when you arrive. I have outlined a breakdown of these costs below. I have also highlighted the item numbers in <strong>bold</strong>. We encourage you to speak with your insurer <strong>prior</strong> to the sleep study to find out what they cover and how much you can claim back.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>12250</strong> &ndash; Home based Sleep Study = <u>$330.00</u></li>
<li>Rental fee of <u>$180.00</u> &ndash; Unfortunately this fee does not have an item code and therefore cannot be claimed back. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cancellation or Change:</strong>&nbsp;Please provide <u>at least 2 working days&rsquo; notice</u> if you need to cancel or change your sleep study booking.&nbsp;This will enable a person on our waiting list to be contacted for testing.&nbsp;If you do not provide this notice, you will be charged an out-of-pocket cancellation fee of $100.00.</p>
<p>If you have any queries or require additional information, please do not hesitate in contacting us on 02 9805 3000.</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming you at the Woolcock Clinic and wish you all the best for your visit.</p>
