Payment of your sleep studies and cancelling or changing your appointment

As a self-funded patient, you are required to pay the full costs for your overnight study and day study. We will ask you to pay this when you arrive.  We encourage you to speak with your insurer prior to the sleep study to find out what they cover and how much you can claim back. 

The cost of your sleep study: 

1.	12254 or 12258 - Adult Diagnostic Sleep Study = $970.00 and
2.	Facility fee of $460.00 – Unfortunately this fee does not have an item code and therefore cannot be claimed back.  


Cancellation or Change: Please provide at least 2 working days’ notice if you need to cancel or change your sleep study booking. This will enable a person on our waiting list to be contacted for testing.  If you do not provide this notice, you will be charged an out-of-pocket cancellation fee of $200.00.
If you have any queries or require additional information, please do not hesitate in contacting us on 02 9114 0000.  

We look forward to welcoming you at the Woolcock Clinic and wish you all the best for your visit.
