<p><strong>Payment of your sleep studies and cancelling or changing your appointment</strong></p>
<p>As a self-funded patient, you are required to pay the full costs for your overnight study and day study. We will ask you to pay this when you arrive.&nbsp; We encourage you to speak with your insurer <strong>prior</strong> to the sleep study to find out what they cover and how much you can claim back.</p>
<p><strong>The cost of your sleep study: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>12254 or 12258</strong> - Adult Diagnostic Sleep Study = <u>$970.00</u> and</li>
<li>Facility fee of <u>$610.00</u> &ndash; Unfortunately this fee does not have an item code and therefore cannot be claimed back. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cancellation or Change:</strong>&nbsp;Please provide <u>at least 2 working days&rsquo; notice</u> if you need to cancel or change your sleep study booking.&nbsp;This will enable a person on our waiting list to be contacted for testing.&nbsp; If you do not provide this notice, you will be charged an out-of-pocket cancellation fee of $200.00.</p>
