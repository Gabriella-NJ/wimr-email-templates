<p>Please note that a specialist referral is valid for 3 months and a GP referral is valid for 12 months. Without a valid referral at the time of your consultation/treatment, Medicare will not be able to process your claim.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Insurance</strong></p>
<p>Approval documentation from your Insurer needs to be provided in the case of a Workers&rsquo; Compensation or Third-Party Claim. If not supplied, payment will need to be made on the day by the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Payment:</strong></p>
<p>The cost of your initial consultation will be $250. We accept EFTPOS, credit cards including AMEX without surcharge (no Diners Club), or cash. We can submit your claim to Medicare on site with a valid referral and Medicare details.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a private clinic and we do not Bulk Bill as a standard rule.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation Fees</strong></p>
<p>When a patient cancels their appointment or does not attend without giving notice, they prevent another patient from being seen.&nbsp; Therefore, your Doctor requires a 48-hour cancellation notice for any appointment changes. A charge of $100 will apply for any appointment changes that may occur without appropriate notice.&nbsp;</p>
