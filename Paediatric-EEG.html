<p>Dear Caregiver,</p>
<p>This email confirms [FIRST_NAME]'s booking for a paediatric EEG appointment at the Woolcock Clinic on [APPOINTMENT_DATE] at [APPOINTMENT_TIME]. Please check in at reception upon arrival.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for the EEG</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your child&rsquo;s hair the night before the EEG. They need to have clean, dry hair with no products applied (e.g. oil, mousse or gel). Please make a new appointment if your child has lice as the test cannot go ahead</li>
<li>Ideally, your child will need to be fairly still during the recording. The EEG technologist is experienced in helping children of all ages to relax, and distractions such as toys and videos are encouraged. Younger children may benefit from dummies, bottles and other comforters, so remember to bring these to the appointment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;It is vital that your child arrives for the EEG tired but awake. Your child will have an opportunity to nap during the EEG. The night before your EEG appointment we ask that you sleep deprive your child according to the following protocol:</p>
<p><em><u>Children aged 3 and under:</u></em> do not allow your child to sleep during the day on the day of the test, and if possible, time the appointment to coincide with usual nap times.</p>
<p><em><u>Children aged 4-8:</u></em> lose 4 hours sleep the night before the EEG. This can be either staying up late the night before, waking up early the morning of the test, or a combination of both. Please ensure that your child does not sleep on the way to the appointment.</p>
<p><em><u>Children aged 8+:</u></em> lose at least 6 hours the night before the EEG. This can be either staying up late the night before, waking up early the morning of the test, or a combination of both. Please ensure that your child does not sleep on the way to the appointment.</p>
<p>Please follow the link and <a href="https://youtu.be/tzQ-w9hmEss">watch this video</a> to prepare your child for their EEG.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
